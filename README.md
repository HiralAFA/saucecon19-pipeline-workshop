## Prerequisites

In order to complete these exercises you must complete the following prerequisite installation and configuration steps:

* Install Git
* Install Node and NPM
* Install an IDE (IntelliJ, WebStorm, Atom etc.)
* Install WebDriverIO
* Setup Project
* (Optional) Install and Configure Jenkins

### Install Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) is a version control system that lets you check out code from a repository, 
work with that code on your own branch, and then merge that code with any changes that have been made by other developers. 
Git is an essential tool for distributed development teams, and is a critical component of the continuous 
integration/continuous development toolchain.

##### MacOSX:

1. Go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Under **Downloads**, click **Mac OS X**.
3. When the download completes, double-click the `.dmg` file open the installer package.
4. Double-click the installer package to begin the installation.
    > *Security Warning*
    >

    If this happens, go to System Preferences > Security and Privacy Settings, and click Open Anyway.
5. Click **Continue** for the installation, and enter your local password to authorize the installation.

##### Windows:

1. Go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

4. Choose LTS, and open up the package to run the installer.
5. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.
6. To ensure NPM and Node.js installed correctly, open a terminal/shell and run the following command:
   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
  [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) lets you develop and deploy JavaScript applications on desktops and servers. If you which to download and install the package manually refer to the following instructions:

### Install an IDE

It's recommended to install and Integrated Developer Environment, or a text editor, to help manage package dependencies, interperters, and overall code execution. There are several options available, some of them are free and some require payment:

* [Atom IDE](https://ide.atom.io/) free, IDE developed by GitHub.
* [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) free trial, paid after 30 days, developed by JetBrains.
* [Komodo Edit](https://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit), free, text editor, stripped down version of [Komodo IDE](https://www.activestate.com/products/komodo-ide/features/) (paid version).
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) free, text editor, contains a wealth of community plugins and extensions.

In our examples we use IntelliJ Community version. [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is an integrated development environment that incorporates several tools for developing and running Java code. You will be using IntelliJ to write and edit the sample Selenium scripts used in the exercises.  For these exercises you only need to download the free Community edition.

### Install WebDriverIO

[WebDriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) is the next gen test framework for NodeJS that's an independent implementation of the JSON Wire Protocol that wraps lower level requests into a concise syntax.

Currently NodeJS bindings are available so to install WebDriverIO you must have NPM and internet access:
```aidl
    $ npm install webdriverio
```
For more information, please refer to the [WebDriverIO GitHub Page](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio) 
<br />

### Setup the Project


1. **Create a Project Directory**:
    * Create a directory on your filesystem to store the project files. You can create the directory using the IDE toolbar or the command line. Below is an example of using the command line to create your project directory:

    
        
### (Optional) Install and Configure Jenkins

A Jenkins build server is provided during the workshop, if you wish to re-produce the setup on your local machine consult the instructions located in the [./jenkins-guides/](./jenkins-guide/JENKINS-SETUP.md#install-jenkins) directory.

### (Optional) Install and Configure Docker

Additionally, if you wish to deploy and manage Jenkins via Docker containers, consult the instructions located in the [./jenkins-guides/](./jenkins-guide/JENKINS-SETUP.md#optional-deploy-jenkins-using-docker) directory.

# Exercise Companion
Fizz Buzz challenge: The goal of the workshop is to complete one or any of the following challenges.

### Challenge 1
Create function expressions for integers between 1-100.
    * If divisible by 3, output "Fizz"
    * If divisible by 5, output "Buzz"
    * If divisible by 3 & 5, output "FizzBuzz"
    * Else, print nothing or **null**
    
### Challenge 2 (Intermediate)
Print **"out of range"** and/or **"not an integer"** error messages

### Challenge 3 (Advanced)
Allow for custom number ranges with outputs
   
   > Break into teams of three: One person is tester, one person is ops (manages Jenkins job execution), one person is developer. All individuals must stay in their own realm! The purpose is to simulate how one navigates a siloed work environment and bridge communication gagps
